Exercises for the SST Tutorial, "Building a Simulator"

From https://github.rcac.purdue.edu/green349/sst-tutorial<BR>
Which has more than https://github.com/sstsimulator/sst-tutorials/tree/master/exercises


Ex1:    Simple, 4-component simulation:
    Miranda-based CPU, L1, L2, and Memory

Ex2:    Same simulation, adds configurability
    Parsing command-line arguments, and reading parameters from a config file

Ex3:    Multi-Core
    Merlin-based on-chip network
    Multiple cores on the chip
    Directory Controller in front of Memory Controller

Ex4:    Modular CPUs
    Can swap-out Merlin for an Ariel-based simulator

Ex 5:   Ring network
    Changed topology of on-chip network from a start topology to a Ring

Ex 6:   Multiple memories
    Added additional memory controllers

Ex 7:   Full Sandy Bridge
    Each ring-stop defines a group, split L3, an L2, L1 and core

Ex 8:   Merlin topology generator
    Uses the built-in Merlin topology generator to build the ring

Ex 9:   Multiple networks
    Uses the built-in Merlin topology generator to build a mesh network
    At each end-point on the mesh, defines a local network containing
        X cpus, Y L3 caches, Z memory controllers
