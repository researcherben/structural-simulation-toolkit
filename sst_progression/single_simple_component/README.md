I suspect that if I can build a three-component simulation with a fully-connected graph I will be able to scale to larger simulations.

What progression will enable that?
1. create a component
1. register a component with SST
1. create and register 2 components
1. create a link between 2 components
1. send a message between 2 components
1. create and register 3 components with 3 links (1 link per pair)
