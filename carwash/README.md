This directory was intended to contain a progression associated with the carwash tutorial described in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLgehegDe4T2y1badxrxcuvIsX42V64t2x&v=ipxoVb2dEcw
and

examples/carWash/carGenerator.h


There are other tutorials to borrow inspiration from; see
 * Omnet has a tic-toc demo that builds in complexity; see https://docs.omnetpp.org/tutorials/tictoc/
 * SimPy has a set of tutorials including carwash; see https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/index.html
 * traffic signals, e.g., stop light; see https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6632548
