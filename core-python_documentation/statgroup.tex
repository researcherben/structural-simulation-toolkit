\section{StatisticGroup}

The StatisticsGroup object is used to group Statistics object together
to be written to the same StatisticOutput object.

NOTE: The StatisticGroup object had limited use in the past and is
evolving to include new functionality.  This is the proposed
functionality of the class and may not be the final API for the
object.

A StatisticGroup is creating using:

\begin{functiondoc}{StatisticGroup(name)}
  { Constructor for StatisticGroup }

  \param{name} name of the group

  \returns{created StatisticGroup object}
\end{functiondoc}

\begin{functiondoc}{addStatistic(stat)}
  { Adds a statistic to the group. }

  \param{stat} Statistic to add to the group

  \noreturn
\end{functiondoc}

\begin{functiondoc}{addComponent(comp)}
  { Add a component to the group }

  \param{comp} Component/SubComponent to add to the group

  \noreturn
\end{functiondoc}


\begin{functiondoc}{setOutput(output)}
    { Configure how the Statistics in the group should be written }

    \param{output} StatisticOutput object that will record the data

    \noreturn
\end{functiondoc}


\begin{functiondoc}{setFrequency(interval)}
  { Set the frequency or rate (e.g.: \lstinline{"10ms", "25kHz"}) to write out
    the statistics.}

  \param{interval} Interval at which to write out statistics.  A rate
  of ``0ns'' will cause the output to be written only at the
  completion of simulation."

  \noreturn
\end{functiondoc}
